- Is React an automatic event emitting library specifically for rendering functions? I have built some event emitting in to the app and it feels tempting to turn the class in to a React class, use setState and expect it to update the listening objects but I don't think there's a way to make that work. It is React.Dom afterall.

# Lessons
Tests exist to notify you when changes occur in places you don't expect them to change. They should not exist in places where changes might occur expectedly. If they exist in the latter then you have fragile tests. However there is no harm in adding a fragile test if you don't have a more robust test at a higher level yet. There's also no harm in adding a fragile test to bolster an area you don't believe should be modified by a refactoring you are doing. These tests can be made deliberately temporary to serve the purpose and then be deleted. There is almost no cost in making a quick snapshot integration test at any layer you want, even if leaving that test in would be considered detimental to your persistent test suit. This is particularly true while you are building out to a position where you can create end-to-end tests, but before you can create end-to-end tests.
